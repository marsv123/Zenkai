Prompt for Replit

Please refine and polish the UI/UX across all Zenkai pages with a focus on clarity, intuitiveness, and professional design consistency.

🔹 UI/UX Improvements

Ensure all pages (Home, Marketplace, Upload Data, Monetize Data, Build AI, Train AI, Tokenize AI, Dashboard) have a consistent single-frame layout with aligned fields, spacing, and margins.

Improve visual hierarchy: titles, subtitles, and call-to-actions must always be clear, centered, and consistent.

Ensure all buttons and toggles are visually aligned, evenly spaced, and sized consistently across sections.

Apply guided flows for complex actions (Upload → Monetize → Build → Train → Tokenize). Each step should clearly indicate what comes next, with tooltips, hints, or progress indicators.

Replace empty/unfinished sections with well-designed placeholders that show “Coming Soon” or simple dummy content instead of leaving blank space.

🔹 Specific Adjustments

Upload Data

Ownership protection should always show as ON by default.

Zero-knowledge privacy toggle should be aligned neatly under ownership protection.

Add placeholder text for dataset preview if none is available.

Monetize Data

Provide guided pricing suggestion placeholder if AI pricing not available.

Show “Demo Revenue Preview” placeholder values to avoid empty states.

Build AI

Ensure all building block tiles are properly aligned and evenly spaced.

If a category has no modules yet, show “Coming Soon” placeholders.

Train AI

Show sample training logs or a “Demo Output Placeholder” when no logs exist.

Performance monitoring should never be empty — add default placeholder values.

Tokenize AI

Revenue sharing slider should be fully functional and adjustable.

Show placeholder token supply, query price, and staking rewards if not set.

🔹 General Design Guidelines

Maintain the cyberpunk theme with deep orange + white contrast.

Keep the hover effects (e.g. Zenkai logo color swap) consistent.

Add micro-interactions (hover highlights, progress bar animations) for a smoother UX.

Ensure responsiveness across mobile, tablet, desktop.

Accessibility: all forms, toggles, and buttons should have clear ARIA labels, tooltips, and error messages.
