Please redesign the zatorai frontend to look like a professional DeFi/AI dApp with a cyberpunk-Zen aesthetic.

Branding:

Product name: zatorai — the economy of intelligence.

Use the latest meditating samurai logo (the full-body hero version with glowing eyes, hands visible, neon sun background) as the central brand element.

Replace any placeholder icons with this new logo where appropriate.

Style & Theme:

Dark mode first. Background: deep indigo (#1B1F3B) or charcoal (#121212).

Accents: neon orange → red gradient (matching the sun in the logo).

Highlights: subtle gold (#FFD700) for hover effects or details.

Typography: modern and clean (Inter, Space Grotesk, or DM Sans).

Overall vibe: calm, sleek, futuristic, cyberpunk-Zen.

Layout Improvements:

Navbar:

Left: samurai logo + “zatorai.”

Center: navigation links (“home,” “marketplace”).

Right: Wallet connect button (styled in neon orange).

Hero Section:

Large header: “zatorai — the economy of intelligence.”

Subheader tagline: “where data meets ai, a new economy emerges.”

Samurai logo centered with soft glowing aura.

CTA buttons: “explore marketplace” (primary neon orange) and “connect wallet” (secondary outline).

Platform Stats:

Show in card components (rounded, subtle shadows, glowing hover effect).

Use accent icons (dataset, downloads, contributors, rating).

Dataset Marketplace Section:

Display datasets in responsive grid cards with URI, price in IMT, score, and action buttons.

Cards animate slightly on hover.

Register Dataset Form:

Styled card with labeled inputs and a glowing “publish” button.

Use orange accents for inputs/focus states.

Footer:

Minimal, dark, small text: “zatorai — the economy of intelligence, built on 0G.”

Extra polish:

Add subtle cyberpunk neon glow to buttons and hover states.

Ensure full mobile responsiveness with Tailwind breakpoints.

Keep all existing functionality intact (wallet connect, dataset register/buy, summarize).

Goal: The site should look and feel like a production-grade DeFi/AI application (inspired by Uniswap, Aave, Ocean Protocol), but with a unique cyberpunk-Zen identity powered by the meditating samurai logo
