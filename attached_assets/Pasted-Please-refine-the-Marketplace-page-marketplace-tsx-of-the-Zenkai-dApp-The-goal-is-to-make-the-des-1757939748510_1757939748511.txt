Please refine the Marketplace page (marketplace.tsx) of the Zenkai dApp. The goal is to make the design cleaner and the customer journey more intuitive, while keeping all current functionality, design theme, and styling intact.

✅ What to Keep

Do not change the color palette, fonts, cyberpunk-zen aesthetics, or overall branding.

Keep all existing functionality (upload, browse, purchase datasets).

Keep the existing smart contract and backend integrations as-is.

Do not remove or rename any API calls, hooks, or wallet integration.

🎨 What to Improve (UI/UX Enhancements)

Layout & Structure

Reorganize the Marketplace layout so it looks polished and easy to scan.

Use clear visual separation between sections (dataset search, filters, dataset cards, purchase area).

Ensure responsive behavior on both desktop and mobile.

Customer Journey Guidance
Add a simple step-by-step guide directly in the Marketplace page, so a new user understands what to do. For example, at the top of the page, show a horizontal banner or sidebar with:

Step 1: Connect Wallet

Step 2: Browse Datasets

Step 3: Purchase Access with ZAI

Step 4: Use Dataset in AI Composition/Training
These should be visually numbered (1, 2, 3, 4) and styled consistently with the current theme.

Dataset Cards

Make dataset cards cleaner and more intuitive. Each card should clearly show:

Dataset name

Price in ZAI

Reputation score / rating

Short description (truncated if too long)

“Buy Now” button (prominent but not overwhelming)

Remove unnecessary clutter or repeated information.

Intuitive Actions

When hovering or clicking on a dataset card, highlight the primary action (e.g., “Buy Access”).

After purchase, the button should change state (e.g., “Access Granted” or “Download”).

Guided Demo Feel

Optionally, add short inline tooltips or microcopy (e.g., “Click here to see dataset details” / “Press Buy to unlock with ZAI”).

Keep these subtle, aligned with the cyberpunk style.

Accessibility & Clarity

Ensure text contrasts well (no hard-to-read small text).

Add ARIA labels for screen readers if not already present.

⚠️ What NOT to Change

Do not alter the branding (logo, slogan, or name: Zenkai).

Do not modify or remove the ZAI token integration.

Do not replace or change the cyberpunk-zen styling globally.

Do not touch other pages (landing page, How It Works, etc.) — this request is for the Marketplace page only.
