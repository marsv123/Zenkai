Please provide me with a comprehensive, detailed, and fully exhaustive status update of the entire Zenkai dApp project.

The update should cover everything with no omissions and be structured clearly by category.
⚠️ Do not summarize vaguely — give explicit details on what works, what doesn’t, and what is still pending or partially implemented.

🔹 Frontend

Current implementation status of all pages/subsites: Home, Marketplace, Upload Data, Monetize Data, Build AI, Train AI, Tokenize AI, Dashboard, and 404.

For each page: Which components are fully functional, which are placeholders/mockups, and which are unfinished or buggy.

Responsiveness status across desktop, mobile, and tablet.

Accessibility compliance: ARIA labels, screen reader support, keyboard navigation.

Consistency of styling: colors, typography, hover effects.

🔹 Backend & API

Express.js/Node backend status.

Implemented routes (datasets, users, transactions, reviews, AI).

Database status (PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM):

Are models and schemas complete?

Are relationships working properly?

Any pending migrations?

Missing or incomplete backend integrations.

Error handling and logging coverage.

🔹 Smart Contracts

Deployment status of:

ZAI Token (ERC-20)

DatasetRegistry (datasets, marketplace logic)

ContributorNFT (ERC-721 reputation system)

Current contract addresses in use (local/testnet/mainnet).

Which functions are tested and working, which are untested or failing.

Any pending contract upgrades or features.

How contracts are integrated with frontend (via Wagmi/RainbowKit).

🔹 Integrations

IPFS: Uploads, retrieval, pinning, multiple gateways — what’s working, what’s missing.

0G integration: Current status of ownership protection & zero-knowledge privacy.

Wallet integration: RainbowKit/Wagmi — tested across multiple chains/wallets? Fully stable?

Transaction flow: End-to-end dataset upload, monetization, purchase, AI training, tokenization — which flows are functional vs. partially implemented.

AI integrations: OpenAI/Replicate — fully working or placeholder only?

🔹 Marketplace

Dataset marketplace: Search, filters, sorting, cards, buy/rent flows.

AI models marketplace: Tokenized model display and purchase flow.

Pagination, grid/list view — working properly?

Error handling for failed fetches.

🔹 Dashboard

Which features are fully functional:

Reputation/Achievements

Which features use mock data or are still missing.

🔹 User Flows

End-to-end Data Provider Journey (Upload → Monetize → Dashboard).

End-to-end AI Builder Journey (Marketplace → Build → Train → Tokenize → Dashboard).

End-to-end Investor Journey (Marketplace → Dashboard).

For each flow: Which steps are complete and which are blocked.

🔹 Bugs & Technical Debt

Known frontend/UI bugs.

Known backend/API bugs.

Known smart contract issues.

Any technical debt or messy code flagged by developers.

🔹 Demo Readiness

What currently works well enough for a live demo.

What is critical but missing for a functional demo (e.g., dataset purchase flow, IPFS upload).

Any blockers preventing a full end-to-end showcase.

🔹 Recommendations

Priority fixes and improvements required to reach full functionality.

Suggested next steps for stabilizing, polishing, or extending the dApp.

⚡ Please structure the update with clear section headings and bullet points so I can review, share, and decide how to move forward.
