Got it 👍 — from now on, we’ll keep the product name as **all lowercase: `zatorai`**. That makes it clean, modern, and very Web3-native (like uniswap, aave, zora).

Here’s the **refined prompt** for Replit, updated with the lowercase product name:

## 🔹 Final Prompt for Replit AI (Web Redesign)

> Please redesign the **zatorai** frontend to look like a **professional DeFi/AI dApp** with a cyberpunk-Zen aesthetic.
>
> **Branding:**
>
> * Product name: **zatorai — the economy of intelligence**.
> * Use the **latest meditating samurai logo** (the full-body hero version with glowing eyes, hands visible, neon sun background) as the central brand element.
> * Replace any placeholder icons with this new logo where appropriate.
>
> **Style & Theme:**
>
> * **Dark mode first**. Background: deep indigo (#1B1F3B) or charcoal (#121212).
> * **Accents:** neon orange → red gradient (matching the sun in the logo).
> * **Highlights:** subtle gold (#FFD700) for hover effects or details.
> * **Typography:** modern and clean (Inter, Space Grotesk, or DM Sans).
> * Overall vibe: calm, sleek, futuristic, cyberpunk-Zen.
>
> **Layout Improvements:**
>
> * **Navbar:**
>
>   * Left: samurai logo + “zatorai.”
>   * Center: navigation links (“home,” “marketplace”).
>   * Right: Wallet connect button (styled in neon orange).
> * **Hero Section:**
>
>   * Large header: “zatorai — the economy of intelligence.”
>   * Subheader tagline: *“where data meets ai, a new economy emerges.”*
>   * Samurai logo centered with soft glowing aura.
>   * CTA buttons: “explore marketplace” (primary neon orange) and “connect wallet” (secondary outline).
> * **Platform Stats:**
>
>   * Show in **card components** (rounded, subtle shadows, glowing hover effect).
>   * Use accent icons (dataset, downloads, contributors, rating).
> * **Dataset Marketplace Section:**
>
>   * Display datasets in **responsive grid cards** with URI, price in IMT, score, and action buttons.
>   * Cards animate slightly on hover.
> * **Register Dataset Form:**
>
>   * Styled card with labeled inputs and a glowing “publish” button.
>   * Use orange accents for inputs/focus states.
> * **Footer:**
>
>   * Minimal, dark, small text: “zatorai — the economy of intelligence, built on 0G.”
>
> **Extra polish:**
>
> * Add subtle cyberpunk neon glow to buttons and hover states.
> * Ensure full **mobile responsiveness** with Tailwind breakpoints.
> * Keep all existing functionality intact (wallet connect, dataset register/buy, summarize).
>
> Goal: The site should look and feel like a **production-grade DeFi/AI application** (inspired by Uniswap, Aave, Ocean Protocol), but with a unique cyberpunk-Zen identity powered by the meditating samurai logo.

⚡ This gives you a **clear, professional prompt** for Replit AI.

👉 Do you want me to also design a **minimal “loading animation”** (like a glowing samurai outline or rotating sun) for when datasets are fetched, to further polish the UX?
