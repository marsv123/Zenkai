🟠 Zenkai dApp — UX Upgrade & Site Restructure Prompt
🎯 Goal

Redesign the Zenkai dApp frontend into a minimal, cyberpunk-styled, intuitive interface that appeals at first glance, avoids clutter, and guides users through clear workflows.

The new site structure should merge redundant subsites while ensuring all current functionality is preserved and live features remain connected to contracts/APIs.

🌐 New Navigation Structure

Home → Hero tagline, 5-step journey, key stats.

Marketplace → Unified browsing with Datasets and INFTs tabs.

Create → Unified workflow (Upload → Train → Mint).

Dashboard → Wallet, assets, activity, earnings, reputation.

How It Works → Optional page for onboarding (visual walkthrough).

🛠 Page Requirements
🏠 Home

Hero: Samurai/Zenkai logo, tagline: “Powering the Intelligence Economy.”

Typewriter effect tagline + glow hover effect.

5-step card flow: Upload → Train → Mint → Trade → Earn.

Animated stats (datasets, INFTs, revenue).

Footer with GitHub, Docs, Twitter.

🛒 Marketplace

Tabs: Datasets | INFTs.

Filters: Category, Price (ZAI), Ratings, ZK badge toggle.

Sort: Latest, Popular, Price.

Cards: Minimal preview with buy button, badges, royalties, ZK flags.

Marketplace must fetch live data (datasets + INFTs) from contracts/APIs.

🛠 Create (Unified Workflow)

Step-by-step flow (with a progress stepper at the top):

Upload Dataset → form with metadata, price in ZAI, storage (IPFS or 0G), ZK toggle. Returns og:// or ipfs:// URI.

Train → Two tabs:

Inference (live via 0G Compute, wallet signed).

Training (simulated for now, outputs ipfs://mock artifact).

Mint INFT → Form auto-populates dataset URI + model URI. User sets royalties (0–10%), ZK flag, and token metadata. Mint transaction triggers ZenkaiINFT contract.

✨ End state = success screen with Token ID + explorer link.

📊 Dashboard

Overview: Stats (ZAI balance, datasets, INFTs, earnings).

Assets: Grid of user datasets + INFTs with copy buttons.

Activity: Transaction timeline with success/fail states.

Earnings: Charts (revenue, spending).

Reputation: Gamified badges.

📖 How It Works (Optional)

One-page illustration of user journey: Upload → Train → Mint → Trade → Earn.

Kept simple, visual, and minimal.

🎨 Design Guidelines

Minimal, cyberpunk style (glass morphism, neon orange gradients, dark indigo background).

Typography: Orbitron (headings), Inter (body).

Responsive: Mobile-first with collapsible menus.

Keep intuitive clarity: no overwhelming panels, just clean guided steps.

Avoid clutter — every section should breathe.

🚀 Deliverables

Functional, production-ready dApp with new navigation.

All features integrated (no loss of functionality).

Tested end-to-end: dataset upload, inference, training (simulated), INFT mint, marketplace listing, dashboard display.

Retain existing blockchain + API integrations (0G Galileo testnet).

⚡ Final Reminder: The site should feel immediately clear and inviting to first-time users, while still powerful enough for advanced users. Minimalism, guided flows, and intuitive clarity are the priorities.
