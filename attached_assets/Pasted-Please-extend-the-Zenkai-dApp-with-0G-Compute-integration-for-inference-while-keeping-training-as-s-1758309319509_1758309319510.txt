Please extend the Zenkai dApp with 0G Compute integration for inference, while keeping training as simulation until 0G officially enables it.

✅ Backend (Express.js)

Install Dependencies

npm install @0glabs/0g-serving-broker @types/crypto-js@4.2.2 crypto-js@4.2.0 ethers


Environment Variables
Add to .env (don’t hardcode):

PRIVATE_KEY=0x...   # funded 0G Galileo/Newton testnet wallet
RPC_URL=https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai


New Endpoint: /api/og-compute/inference

Initialize broker with ethers.Wallet + RPC.

Discover available services (broker.inference.listService()).

Accept POST body with:

{
  "provider": "0x...",   // provider address
  "prompt": "your query",
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-instruct"
}


Acknowledge provider if needed (broker.inference.acknowledgeProviderSigner).

Submit inference job (broker.inference.getServiceMetadata + fetch to ${endpoint}/chat/completions).

Return:

content (inference output)

provider (address)

model (used)

verification (TEE/zk flag)

New Endpoint: /api/og-compute/train (Simulated)

For now, return:

{
  "status": "simulated",
  "message": "0G Compute training integration coming soon",
  "mockModelURI": "ipfs://simulated-training-artifact"
}


Save URI to DB so it can flow into INFT minting.

✅ Frontend (React/Vite)
🔹 Train AI Page

Split into two tabs:

Inference (Live)

User selects dataset + model → call /api/og-compute/inference.

Show real inference output.

Display provider address, zk/TEE badge, cost (from service metadata).

Training (Simulated)

Keep current training flow, but results point to /api/og-compute/train.

Show message: “0G Compute training is coming soon. This is a simulated preview.”

🔹 Pipeline Integration

Outputs from both inference & training should generate a URI (real from inference, mock from simulation).

This URI should be selectable in the Tokenize (INFT) page as modelURI.

🔹 Marketplace & Dashboard

Marketplace INFT cards should now display:

Dataset URI (ipfs:// or og://)

Model URI (from inference or simulated training)

ZK badge if flagged

✅ Messaging / UX Copy

Update texts to reflect reality:

Train AI Page subtitle:

“Run decentralized inference today with 0G Compute. Training support is coming soon and will integrate seamlessly.”

Inference Results Panel:

“Outputs are computed on 0G Compute testnet nodes, verified via zk/TEE.”

Simulated Training Panel:

“This is a simulation until 0G Compute enables decentralized training.”

✅ Deliverables

New backend routes (/api/og-compute/inference and /api/og-compute/train).

Updated Train AI page with Inference (real) + Training (simulated) tabs.

Pipeline + Tokenize pages updated to handle modelURI from inference/training.

Marketplace/Dashboard updated to display inference-derived INFTs.

UX copy updated for transparency.

⚡ Goal:
Enable real decentralized inference today via 0G Compute SDK, while transparently simulating training until the feature is live. Users experience guided flows, real outputs, and clear messaging.
